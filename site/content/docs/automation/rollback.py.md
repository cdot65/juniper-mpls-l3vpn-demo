#### Imports

asdf

```python
import yaml  # type: ignore
from jnpr.junos import Device  # type: ignore
from jnpr.junos.utils.config import Config  # type: ignore
```

asdf

#### Inventory

asdf

```python

#### Main

asdf

```python
def main(devices):
    """Build connection, template config, and push to device.

    Loop over our list of routers that we imported from inventory.py
    Utilize the ID as the last octet within the IP address of the router

#### Initialize script

asdf

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    """Main script execution.

    We will first load our inventory.yaml file into a new Python object `devices`
    Our main function will run next, which will take care of the templating
    and pushing of our configurations to the remote devices.

    devices = inventory()

### üöÄ Workflow

The workflow will look like this:

1. Have Poetry install your Python packages in a virtual environment (one-time operation)
2. Activate your new virtual environment with Poetry
3. Run locally or within a container using the Invoke package

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
invoke configure
```
