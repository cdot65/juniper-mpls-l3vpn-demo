## Poetry

A [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) lock file to help you create a Python environment that mirrors my own. As long as you [have Poetry installed on your machine](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), to you can simply type `poetry install` to create the virtual environment, followed by `poetry shell` to activate it.

---

### ðŸš€ Workflow

The workflow will look like this:

1. Have Poetry install your Python packages in a virtual environment (one-time operation)
2. Activate your new virtual environment with Poetry
3. Build Docker container image (one-time operation)
4. Run locally or within a container using the Invoke package

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
invoke build
invoke configure
```
