# 🐍 Build and Deploy a MPLS L3VPN with Juniper Networks PyEZ

## Welcome

First off, hello and welcome to the landing page of my demo's documentation. My name is Calvin and I work in the sales organization at Juniper Networks; I hope that you will find this project helpful.

In this demonstration, we will deploy a L3VPN circuit across an MPLS backbone using Juniper's PyEZ library. For those without access to Juniper's vLabs, I have provided a sample lab topology for EVE-NG within the project files.

## Automation Overview
Job briefings are an important part of planning safe work. Job briefings are also required by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) [29 CFR 1926.952](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ceeaf016fdd21de13fffb416153479ad&node=se29.8.1926_1952&rgn=div8). This work practice will help you understand what to expect during job briefings and how to participate to comply with OSHA requirements.

## Network Topology
This work practice describes the four elements of job briefings: daily briefing, job site assessment, job briefing, and post-job briefing. This work practice explains when each element is completed, what you can expect to talk about during each element, and the required documentation for each element.
 
This work practice is intended to help crew members understand each element of a job briefing, including how they must contribute and participate. This work practice does not describe crew supervisor, Employee in Charge (EIC), or designated crew member (DCM) responsibilities.

## Provisioning with PyEZ

There are four elements of job briefings:

1. Daily briefing.
2. Job site assessment.
3. Job briefing.
4. Post-job briefing.  

Every job requires these four elements, including storm response and service restoration jobs.

> **Note:**
> When you work alone, you must complete the four elements of a job briefing as carefully as when you are part of a crew. Lone worker briefings are planning processes that include thinking through all of the same topics as crew briefings, including hazards, work procedures, and emergency plans.
> 
> You do not have to document job briefings as a lone worker. If you start a job by working alone, but another crew member or entire crew arrives later to help, you do have to document job briefings, starting when the other crew member or crew arrives at the job site.
 
### Daily Briefing

The EIC or DCM will hold a daily briefing at the beginning of each work day. All the crew members who will work on the job that day have to attend the daily briefing. The daily briefing gets the entire crew involved in planning for the day’s work.
 
The daily briefing is held at your reporting location, not at the job site.
